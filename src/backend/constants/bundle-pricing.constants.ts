 *
 * Rule:
 *   - Customers cannot purchase single packets.
 *   - The only purchasable unit is a BUNDLE of 10 packets.
 *   - Price per packet: ₹64
 *   - Price per bundle: ₹640 (10 × ₹64)
 *   - Bonus: +2 free packets per bundle (customer pays for 10, receives 12)
 *   - Shipping: ALWAYS ₹0 (Free Delivery on every order)
 *   - This applies identically across ALL varieties/flavors.
